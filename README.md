# Ruby-Raspberry_Pi_IoT
A Ruby library for IoT (physical computing) projects with Raspberry Pi.

Why I made it.

I'm a software developer and a maker. And I do love Raspberry Pi - 
it's such a fun to do physical programming! But I love to program in Ruby. 
So I tried to make a pragmatic set of useful IoT libraries for the Ruby language 
for all who want to program for Raspberry Pi in Ruby.

# Raspberry_Pi_IoT

A Ruby library for IoT (physical computing) projects with Raspberry Pi.

## Main classes

All the devices are traditionally divided into 2 main classes:
```
(IoT device)
   |
   |-----Receptor (Sensor) ~ some thing that can sense something from the outer world.
   |
   |-----Effector (Actuator) ~ some thing that can effect something in the outer world.
```
Sometimes the both roles could br combined in one multi-component device like **Sense HAT**.
